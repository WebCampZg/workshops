Hi XXX,

the workshop dates are drawing closer and we wanted to ask you if there are some special requirements you would like your attendees to get done, such as:
bringing their laptops with them
installing some software / setting up a special env on their laptops
reading some pre-workshop prep material
preparing some materials
bringing writing supplies, such as pens, pencils, and/or notebooks
anything else

If you would like them to do something like this as a preparation for the workshop, please let us know - we'll send them an email with instructions as detailed as you want.

We're sure you would like to know how the workshop sales went, so here it is:

Your workshop, `XXX`, sold YYY tickets.

As always - if you have any questions, just let us know and we'll do our best to help!

Best wishes,

WebCamp Zg Workshops Team
