Hi XXX,

Our plan is to release the schedule on Wednesday (June 19th), together with talk announcements. We scheduled your workshop for Thursday, Oct 10 at AA:00-BB:00, and as previously discussed ticket price would be XX EUR (YY EUR with VAT) for your workshop, can you confirm you are OK with both? 

We checked and we can wire you your share of the profits, but we still have a question about selling less than 20 tickets, should we cancel it in that case?

Regarding the accommodation, we would cover the extra nights so you don't have to worry about that, would you be coming to Zagreb on Wednesday (Oct 9th)?

We will also invite you to workshops slack channel soon, Slack is just one of the communication channels we will be using. Don't worry, all of the announcements will be sent by email as well.

ZZZ and I are in charge of workshops, if you have any questions feel free to ask here or on the Slack at anytime.

Cheers,

YYY
