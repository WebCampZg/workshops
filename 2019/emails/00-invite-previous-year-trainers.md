WebCamp Zagreb 2019 is looking for workshops

Dear XXX,

We loved your workshop last year, would you be interested in
submitting another one this year?

This year, workshop proposals are gathered thru CFP, which should make
all of our lifes a bit easier ;) You can find all of the details here:
https://2019.webcampzg.org/cfp/ .

Also there is a big news as well: WebCamp Zagreb is bringing an extra
track for advanced topics, if you have 'crazy' topics that you are
passionate about but dont feel it has broad interest, this could be a
great place to try them out!

Cheers,

YYY
