Hi XXX,

We are happy to invite you to do `XXX` in Zagreb

Conference schedule:

Oct 9th (Wed): Workshop day 1
Oct 10th (Thu): Workshop day 2 + speakers dinner
Oct 11th (Fri): Conference day 1
Oct 11th (Sat): Conference day 2

While we do hope you are still interested and your schedule has not
changed, there are some questions we would like to ask you:

1) Since you have not submitted any talks, would you be interested in
staying in for the conference? For workshop trainers we offer up to
200EUR travel reimbursement,  2 (or 3 if there are issues with
flights) nights covered, an invitation to speakers dinner and a
conference ticket.

2) Do you have any preferences around Wednesday vs Thursday to do your workshop?

3) We are a community (non-profit) organized event, our default setup
is to have revenue share of 50% with the trainers (you can wave it off
or if your company is interested we can transform it to a
sponsorship). We are open to different setup, what is your preffered
arrangement? (fixed price, revenue share or something else).

As we do not have fixed workshop prices, based on different options
(local trainers, revenue share etc), our suggested pricing for a full
day workshop is between XX EUR and YY EUR.

4) Are you able to invoice us for your share of the workshop?

5) Do you have minimal and maximal number of attendees? Ballparks are OK


Cheers,

YYY
