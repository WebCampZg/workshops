Hi XXX,

When invoicing for travel reimbursement can you also put in the speaker fee, your XY% is XZ EUR (without VAT, from my understanding VAT should not be charged for services). 

I'm adding ZZZ to email, he's an expert for this part and he will handle all of the payment details and stuff.

Cheers,
YYY
