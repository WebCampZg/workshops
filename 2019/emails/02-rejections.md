Dear XXX,

Unfortunately, your workshop submission was not selected for WebCamp Zagreb 2019. This year we had 46 submissions, with only 10-15 slots available we had to discard many fine workshops.

We still hope we'll see you at workshops (https://2019.webcampzg.org/workshops/) and/or conference (https://2019.webcampzg.org/talks/), feel free to say hi!

If you want us to remind you for next years CFP, please reply to this email with "Yeah, remind me" (it's not only about GDPR, we dislike spamming people).

Best regards,
WebCamp Workshops Team
