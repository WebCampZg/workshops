Dear XXX,

we're really happy to have had you give your workshop this year and we hope you are satisfied with how it went.
We really hope you loved it as much as we do - it was a blast this year! 

We would like to ask you to give us, as workshop organizers, your opinion and feedback about the whole process - from the initial contact to the very end of your stay.
We believe that anything we did wrong, failed at or that needs (or at least could use) improvements is as important as all the good parts, as it will give us an opportunity to be better at what
we do. 

We don't have any strict or predefined format, so a free form email will be just fine.

Additionally, we have prepared a JoindIn event with an entry for your workshop: https://joind.in/talk/XXXXXXXXX

We suggest you claim your workshop as soon as possible, as we'll be sending out an email to your attendees asking them to give feedback and rate the workshop.

Some of the trainers have already shared their presentation slides and other materials, so if you would like to do that as well, you can send them to us and we'll forward the materials to them (you can attach them or send a link to them if you have them somewhere online).

If you have any question, please feel to send us an email.

Cheers,
Workshop team
