Dear attendee,

we would like to thank you for your participation on this years' workshops and hope you had as much fun while learning something new as we did.

In order to better understand the needs and wishes of the community, we have prepared a short questionnaire related to the organization of the workshop you attended:
XYZ

The form is anonymous and no personal data is being collected.

Also, please remember that leaving feedback for the trainers and their workshops, as well as for the talks on the main event, helps them improve their delivery skills and the content they provide: please take a moment and leave the workshop feedback at JoindIn:
ABC

Best wishes,

WebCamp Zagreb Workshops Team

P.S. - we've decided to create a raffle with some very cool prizes - we're giving away 1 ticket for a next years' workshop of your choosing and 2 tickets for next years' WebCampZagreb conference.

In order to be eligible for a contest, all you need to do is leave feedback on workshops and talks you attended this year. The deadline is this Friday at midnight.
Good luck! :)
