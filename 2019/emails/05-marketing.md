Hi XXX,

Now that summer is over, we are increasing our marketing efforts: we already have one workshop completely sold out! We will be marketing them through our user groups and conference social media but would like to reach a broader audience, and this is something we need you for. Would you be willing to help us by posting on social media a link to your workshop (https://2019.webcampzg.org/workshops/xxxxxxxx/) and some small text about what to expect / why join the workshop?

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.

Cheers,

WebCampZg Workshops Team
