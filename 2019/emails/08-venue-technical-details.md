Hi XXX,

thanks for the info - we'll notify your attendees of your requirements.

We'd just like to inform you of some technical details regarding the venue:

- all workshop rooms will have HDMI cable and power outlets available at the trainer's desk
- If your laptop doesn't have HDMI port, please remember to bring your adapter/converter, depending on your needs - we won't be able to provide you with one, unfortunately
- If you have any electronic device chargers not compatible with the "F" Type power outlet, please remember to bring your own adapters and converters if necessary. The "F" Type power outlets are a standard in Croatia and you will have them in your hotel rooms as well
- unfortunately, we won't be able to provide you with any of the following, so if you need any of the following items, please remember to bring your own: presentation remotes for the workshops, writing supplies (pens, pencils, papers, notebooks).
- we have a limited number of flipcharts available - please let us know if you need one so that we might arrange it for you

If you have any questions, technical requirements or assumptions about the workshops venue, please let us know - best we try to handle everything beforehand while there's still time.

Best regards,

WebCampZg Workshops Team
