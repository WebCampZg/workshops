Hi XXX,

First and foremost, thank you for submitting a workshop to this years
WebCamp Zagreb conference.

We are really interested in your workshop but, in all honesty, are bit
worried with lack of recorded presentations in English. Would you mind
if we do a short skype or zoom.us video call just to talk for few
minutes?

I know this is a rather unortodox step, but we really do want to give
everyone a fair chance: some speakers and trainers had no opportunity
to speak or be recorded in English while being quite well spoken. We
do not expect you to be at native English speaker level, but  having a
full day workshop would expect lot more communication and interactions
than a talk that can be much  rehearsed.


Cheers,

YYY
